next steps:
 * run N commands
 * compare the commands with each other
 * colors and shit
 * run the commands multiple times and collect min/max/avg etc
 * mad max mode

feature wishlist
 * when a command fails, show the stderr by default
 * show peak rss in addition to wall clock time
 * show other hardware counters
 * by default, only do 2-3 runs if a run takes longer than 5 seconds
