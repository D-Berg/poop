next steps:
 * don't change the good/bad color if difference is within measurement error
 * add page faults
 * align stuff better
 * investigate outliers. keep removing them?
 * detect statistical outliers
 * reexamine the conditions for marking the ratio insignificant (std_dev?)
 * warmup phase
 * break std.fmt
 * pre-report the current estimate
 * mad max mode

feature wishlist
 * when a command fails, show the stderr by default
